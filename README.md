# Freyja-data
Previous versions of Freyja barcodes and metadata files


This repo contains a list of all currently barcoded lineages ```barcoded_lineages.txt```, the associated barcodes ```usher_barcodes.csv```, and the most recent metadata ```curated_lineages.json```. 

Whenever new lineages are designated and added to the UShER public tree, these files will be updated. Old versions of these files are timestamped and placed into the appropriate "history" directory.
